# House-price-prediction-using-flask
ðŸ“Œ About the Project
This project demonstrates the predictive capabilities of a model trained on house price data using Linear Regression. The model is deployed using a Flask API, providing an interface to predict house prices based on input features.

This House Price Prediction web application uses machine learning to estimate property prices based on user-input features like bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, year of construction, and location.

## Installation

You'll need to install the required libraries to run this web app on your local machine. These are listed in the requirements.txt file. The project was developed using Python 3.8.0 and Flask 2.0.1.<br><br> Install the necessary packages by running the following command in your terminal:<br><br>

```
pip install -r requirement.txt
```
<br>

## Getting Started

After installing the required packages, you can start the application by executing the following command in your terminal:<br><br>
```
python app.py
```
<br>

## How to Use:
1.Enter the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, floors, year built, and select the location from the dropdown.<br>
2.Click the "Predict" button.<br>
3.The app will display the estimated house price based on the trained ML model.<br>
<br>

## Key Feature: 
âœ… Accurate Price Prediction using Machine Learning (linear regression.)<br>
âœ… User-Friendly UI built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br>
âœ… Location-Based Prediction with dropdown selection.<br>
âœ… Interactive & Responsive Design.<br>
âœ… Easy to Use â€“ Just enter details and get instant results.<br>
<br>


## Technology Used:
Flask (for backend)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend)
Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy (for ML Model)
Pickle (model.pkl) (to save and load ML model)
